This is my first raycasting engine. It uses the school-provided minilibX<br>
to draw on screen and is completely written in C. To check out the demo<br>
clone the project, go to the root dir and type 'make run' in the terminal.<br>
Also make sure you are on macOS. Otherwise it may or may not work :)

<b> Features </b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Splash screen at the end of the level</li>
  <li>Mouse and keyboard controls</li>
  <li>Distance related shadows</li>
  <li>Vertical reflections</li>
  <li>Directional textures</li>
  <li>Background music</li>
  <li>Item counter</li>
</ul>
  
I'm not completely happy with the raycasting algorithm so this is still<br>
an ongoing project.
